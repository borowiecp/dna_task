# How should I start
1. install required dependencies by running the `composer install` command
2. run tests by executing the `./vendor/bin/phpunit` command
3. for general simplicity the app uses the same sqlite file as the tests. 
As a result there's no need to migrate the database once the tests have been executed.
However, in case of any difficulties, the `php artisan migrate` and `php artisan migrate:rollback`
commands could be executed.
4. run the `php artisan serve` command to see whether the server starts

- This data can be used for reporting.

# Tasks
